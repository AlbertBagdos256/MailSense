## 🚀 Project Overview

**Project Name:** MailSense 
**Scope:** Email spam detection and intelligent email categorization  
**Platforms:** Gmail and Outlook  
**Audience:** Students, Developers, Professionals — anyone who uses email  

### 🎯 In One Sentence
A Chrome extension that detects spam and categorizes emails into relevant groups using AI.

---

## ✨ Dream Features

- 🚫 Spam detection using a custom ML model  
- 🧠 Smart email categorization (e.g., Work, School, Internship)  
- 🌐 Support for both Gmail and Outlook  
- 🔒 Privacy-focused — all processing done securely via our API  
- ⚙️ Fast integration between Chrome Extension and API backend  
- 🪄 (Future) LLM integration for deeper semantic understanding of emails

## 🧩 Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### ✅ MVP Description
The simplest version of the product detects spam and categorizes incoming emails using a trained ML model.

### 🔹 Input
Email text and metadata (subject, body, sender)

### 🔹 Output
Categorized emails under labels like:
- `Spam`
- `Internship`
- `Work`

## 🧠 Frameworks, Libraries & Tools

| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| **Browser Extension** | JavaScript, HTML, CSS |
| **Backend API** | Python (Flask or FastAPI) |
| **ML / AI Models** | PyTorch, NumPy |
| **LLM Integration** | LLaMA, OpenAI (open-source LLM, fine-tuned for categorization) |
| **Cloud Infrastructure** | Google Cloud (for API hosting and storage) |
| **Design Tools** | Figma (for UI), Lucidchart / draw.io (for system design diagrams) |

---

## 🗂️ Project Workflow

### 🧱 System Design
1. Chrome Extension captures email data (securely via API).
2. Data sent to FastAPI backend.
3. Backend runs:
   - First check if the email is spam or not:
   - If it is spam run the spam detection model and categorize it as spam
   - If not spam run email categorization LLM model and categorize it
5. Categorization results returned to extension.
6. Chrome extension displays categorized emails in the Gmail/Outlook interface.

### 🎨 Figma Design
The Figma prototype includes:
- Email dashboard layout
- Category filtering UI
- Highlighting for spam vs. safe emails
